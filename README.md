# Random-Forest-for-Predicting-Bank-Marketing-Success-
Random Forest
This project is an application of the Random Forest algorithm to predict the success of a bank's marketing campaign for a particular product. The dataset used in this project is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution, and contains variables such as age, job, marital status, education, balance, housing, loan, contact, and more.

The Random Forest model was trained and optimized using techniques such as cross-validation and parameter tuning to achieve maximum accuracy in predicting whether a customer would subscribe to the product or not. The project also includes data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

The results of the Random Forest model were compared with other classification models such as logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors. The evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Overall, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of Random Forest in predicting bank marketing success and provides insights into the factors that influence customer decisions.
